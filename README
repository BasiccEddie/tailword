# TailWord – Discord Word Chain Bot

TailWord is a multiplayer word-chain game bot for Discord servers, built to keep communities active and competitive.

Players take turns sending words where each new word must start with the final letter of the previous one. Break the chain, and the round resets!

TailWord adds stats, leaderboards, rewards, and global gameplay progression across servers.

## How the Game Works

1. A player starts with any word.
2. The next player must send a word starting with the previous word’s last letter.
3. The same player cannot play twice in a row.
4. Used words cannot be repeated in a round.
5. If a player fails, the chain resets and a new round begins.

Example:
apple → egg → grape → elephant → tiger
