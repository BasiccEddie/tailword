The Bot may store the following information:

a) Discord Identifiers

4. Purpose of Data Collection

Users acknowledge use of the Service at their own risk.

8. User Control & Data Removal

Server administrators may remove stored data by removing the Bot from their server.

Users may contact the Owner regarding concerns or data questions.

Due to minimal data storage, individual data removal requests may not always be technically possible without affecting gameplay records.

9. Children's Privacy

The Bot follows Discord’s platform rules and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under applicable digital consent laws.

10. Service Changes

The Bot may change data handling practices as features evolve. Continued use implies acceptance of updates.
